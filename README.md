# sketch-box

The goal of this project is to create a sketchpad that consisting of 
a large grid of squares that will respond to mouse over events.
The squares will initially turn black, but as the program develops 
options to select other colors or different sized grids will be 
available. The overall look and design of the webpage itself will also 
be improved upon.
